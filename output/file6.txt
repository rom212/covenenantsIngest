to enter into this Agreement and to make the Loans and issue or participate in the Letters of Credit, the Borrower hereby represents

Condition. </b>The consolidated balance sheet of the Borrower and its consolidated Subsidiaries as at each of December&nbsp;31, 2019
and December&nbsp;31, 2020 and the related consolidated statements of operations and of cash flows for the fiscal years ended on such
dates, reported on by Ernst&nbsp;&amp; Young LLP, copies of which have heretofore been furnished to each Lender, are complete and correct
and present fairly the consolidated financial condition of the Borrower and its consolidated Subsidiaries as at such dates, and the consolidated
results of their operations and their consolidated cash flows for the fiscal years then ended. The unaudited consolidated balance sheet
of the Borrower and its consolidated Subsidiaries as at the date of the Borrower�s most recent publicly available Form&nbsp;10-Q
and the related unaudited consolidated statements of operations and of cash flows for the fiscal period ended on such date, certified
by a Responsible Officer, copies of which have heretofore been furnished to each Lender, are complete and materially correct and present
fairly (subject to normal year-end audit adjustments) the consolidated financial condition of the Borrower and its consolidated Subsidiaries
as at such date, and the consolidated results of their operations and their consolidated cash flows for the fiscal period then ended.
All such annual financial statements, including the related schedules and notes thereto, were, as of the date prepared, prepared in accordance
with GAAP applied consistently throughout the periods involved (except as approved by such accountants or Responsible Officer, as the
case may be, and as disclosed therein). The quarterly financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form&nbsp;10-Q and Article&nbsp;10 of Regulation S-X under
the Securities Act of 1933. Accordingly, such quarterly financial statements do not include all of the information and footnotes required
by GAAP for complete financial statements. In the opinion of the Borrower, all adjustments (consisting only of normal recurring accruals)
considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included. Neither the Borrower nor any of its consolidated Subsidiaries had, at
the date of the most recent balance sheet referred to above, any of the following except as disclosed in the Borrower�s Form&nbsp;10-K
and 10-Q filings: any material Guarantee Obligation, material contingent liability or material liability for taxes, or any material long-term
lease or material unusual forward or long-term commitment, including, without limitation, any interest rate or foreign currency swap
or exchange transaction, which is not reflected in the foregoing financial statements or in the notes thereto.</p>
