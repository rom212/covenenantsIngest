Agent written notice that such Majority Lenders accept such amendment. No replacement of a Benchmark with a Benchmark Replacement pursuant

such ABR Loan denominated in Dollars shall then be converted by the Administrative Agent to, and shall constitute, a Eurocurrency Loan
denominated in such original Available Foreign Currency (in an amount equal to the Available Foreign Currency Equivalent of such Available
