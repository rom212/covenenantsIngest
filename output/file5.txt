for Issuance of Letter of Credit. </b>The Borrower may from time to time request that the Issuing Lender issue a Letter of Credit by
delivering to the Issuing Lender at its address for notices specified herein an Application therefor, completed to the satisfaction of
the Issuing Lender, and such other certificates, documents and other papers and information as the Issuing Lender may request. Upon receipt
of any Application, the Issuing Lender will process such Application and the certificates, documents and other papers and information
delivered to it in connection therewith in accordance with its customary policies and procedures and shall promptly issue the Letter
of Credit requested thereby (but in no event shall the Issuing Lender be required to issue any Letter of Credit earlier than three Business
Days after its receipt of the Application therefor and all such other certificates, documents and other papers and information relating
thereto) by issuing the original of such Letter of Credit to the beneficiary thereof or as otherwise may be agreed to by the Issuing
Lender and the Borrower. The Issuing Lender shall furnish a copy of such Letter of Credit to the Borrower promptly following the issuance
thereof. The Issuing Lender shall promptly furnish to the Administrative Agent, which shall in turn promptly furnish to the Lenders,
notice of the issuance of each Letter of Credit (including the amount thereof). If the Borrower so requests, the applicable Issuing Lender
may, in its sole and absolute discretion, agree to issue a Letter of Credit that has automatic extension provisions (each, an �<u>Auto-Extension
Letter of Credit</u>�); <u>provided</u>, that any such Auto-Extension Letter of Credit must permit such Issuing Lender to prevent
any such extension at least once in each 12-month period (or such longer period in the case of a Letter of Credit with an expiration
in excess of 12 months) (commencing with the date of issuance of such Letter of Credit) by giving prior notice to the beneficiary thereof
not later than a day (the �<u>Non-Extension Notice Date</u>�) in each such 12-month period (or such longer period in the
case of a Letter of Credit with an expiration in excess of 12 months) to be agreed upon at the time such Letter of Credit is issued.
Unless otherwise directed by the applicable Issuing Lender, the Borrower shall not be required to make a specific request to such Issuing
Lender for any such extension. Once an Auto-Extension Letter of Credit has been issued, the Lenders shall be deemed to have authorized
(but may not require) the applicable Issuing Lender to permit the extension of such Letter of Credit at any time to an expiry date not
later than the Termination Date; <u>provided</u>, <u>however</u>, that such Issuing Lender shall not permit any such extension if (i)&nbsp;such
Issuing Lender has determined that it would not be permitted, at such time to issue such Letter of Credit in its revised form (as extended)
under the terms hereof, or (ii)&nbsp;it has received notice (which may be by telephone or in writing) on or before the day that is five
Business Days before the Non-Extension Notice Date (A)&nbsp;from the Administrative Agent that the Majority Lenders have elected not
to permit such extension or (B)&nbsp;from the Administrative Agent, any Lender or the Borrower that one or more of the applicable conditions
specified in Section&nbsp;7 are not then satisfied, and in each such case directing such Issuing Lender not to permit such extension.</p>
