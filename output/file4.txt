or branches) is a party as a �<u>Local Currency Facility</u>�, with the consent of the Administrative Agent and each such
Lender in its sole discretion, by delivering a Local Currency Facility Addendum to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders (through
the Administrative Agent) executed by the Borrower, each such Foreign Subsidiary Borrower and each such Lender, <u>provided</u>, that

with applicable �know your customer� and anti-money laundering rules&nbsp;and regulations, including the Patriot Act and
the Beneficial Ownership Regulation, as reasonably requested by the Lenders. Except as otherwise provided in this <u>Section&nbsp;4</u>
or in the definition of �<u>Qualified Credit Facility</u>� in <u>subsection 1.1</u>, the terms and conditions of each Local
Currency Facility shall be determined by mutual agreement of the relevant Foreign Subsidiary Borrower(s), Local Currency Lender(s)&nbsp;and
the Administrative Agent. The documentation governing each Local Currency Facility shall (i)&nbsp;contain an express acknowledgement
that such Local Currency Facility shall be subject to the provisions of this <u>Section&nbsp;4</u>, (ii)&nbsp;if more than one Lender
is a party thereto, designate a Local Currency Facility Agent for such Local Currency Facility and (iii)&nbsp;include an opinion of counsel
reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent from the jurisdiction in which such Local Currency Facility is established that the
documentation governing such Local Currency Facility is enforceable in accordance with its terms. Each of the Borrower and, by agreeing
to any Local Currency Facility designation as contemplated hereby, each relevant Local Currency Lender (if any) party thereto which is
an Affiliate, branch or agency of a Lender, acknowledges and agrees that each reference in this Agreement to any Lender shall, to the
extent applicable, be deemed to be a reference to such Local Currency Lender. In the event of any inconsistency between the terms of
this Agreement and the terms of any Local Currency Facility, the terms of this Agreement shall prevail.</p>
